## What’s the %product% admin?

Merchants set up their store, configure settings, and manage their business using the admin. It includes core aspects of the merchant’s business, including orders, products, and customers.

## What is %product%?

%product% is the design system for the %product% admin. It’s the shared language that guides how we build high-quality merchant experiences.

The design system is made up of design guidance, code libraries, development opinions, and API documentation on how to build merchant experiences for the %product% admin.

## Who is %product% for?

%product% is used both internally at %product% and externally by app developers and designers.

## What are %product% apps?

The admin includes installable apps that are distributed through the %product% App Store. They enable merchants to add functionality to their stores without leaving the familiar environment of the admin.

By building with %product% and [App Bridge](https://shopify.dev/apps/tools/app-bridge) and following the [App Design Guidelines](https://shopify.dev/apps/design-guidelines), you'll create a streamlined experience with the rest of the %product% admin.
